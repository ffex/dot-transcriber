  this is the abstract for the project:
  Dot is a AI name that help me, the basic functionality is to be a telegram bot. When I am in the car or maybe walk I want to record a telegram message and send it. I want that Dot transcribe it (I'm italian) and tranform the content
  in a multiple note like to build a second-brain (like the app Obsidian). So I want that the notes are in .md. I am a developer so very often I want to record message about project, so there is a second phase that a model re-elaborate
  to find some task to do to continue the project that I talk about.
  SO I think about some main phase to build this project:
  - make a Bot Telegram that receive audio
  - Transcribe the audio in text (I want to search how)
  - give this text to a model (maybe local with ollama or via api) to retrive notes in .md format
  - <optional> create some tasks

  I want build this project with you claude so maybe we need:
  - a file with all of this information and all the steps and we can use this file to keep track about our work. in every phase you can create some small task so we can start(call it WhereAreWe.md
  - maybe create a file with some prompts for you? some prompts to complete tasks well and some to update the WhereAreWe.md?
  - we do the work toghere so if you think that we need other things do it!
